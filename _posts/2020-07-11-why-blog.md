# Intentions vs Goals

## The road to failure is made easier by good intentions

I intend to write but experience has proven that intent is not a good motivator; I need to know why and how an action maps to a goal. 

My current goals are: 
- stop googling around for solutions to the same problems
- a single repository for documenting problems/solutions 
- a single repository for sharing and discussing ideas

Writing address all 3.
