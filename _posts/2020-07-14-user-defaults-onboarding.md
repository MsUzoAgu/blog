# FirstTimeUser or Nah?

## User Defaults
We can determine if a user is a first time user by setting boolean flags via **UserDefaults**, which Apple defines [UserDefaults](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/userdefaults) as: 
>An interface to the userâ€™s defaults database, where you store key-value pairs persistently across launches of your app.

I find **UserDefaults** very useful for determine things like: 
  - is a customer a first time user?
  - is a customer a beta tester?
