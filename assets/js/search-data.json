            "content": "FirstTimeUser or Nah? . User Defaults . We can determine if a user is a first time user by setting boolean flags via UserDefaults, which Apple defines UserDefaults as: . An interface to the user’s defaults database, where you store key-value pairs persistently across launches of your app. . I find UserDefaults very useful for determine things like: . is a customer a first time user? | is a customer a beta tester? | . Setup . We all have to deal with onboarding at some point so below are general steps to get one started. . create a boolean flag in the coordinator responsible for handling the OnBoarding flow: class AppCoordinator: Coordinator { func start() { let isFirstTimeUser = UserDefaults.standard.bool(forKey: &quot;isFirstTimeUser&quot;) if (isFirstTimeUser) { presentOnboarding() } else { presentDefaultFlow() } } } . Substitue coordinator for AppDelegate/SceneDelegate if you don’t follow the coordinator pattern: . class SceneDelegate: UIResponder, UIWindowSceneDelegate { func functionThatDeterminesWhatVCToPresent() { let isFirstTimeUser = UserDefaults.standard.bool(forKey: &quot;isFirstTimeUser&quot;) if (isFirstTimeUser) { presentOnboarding() } else { presentDefaultFlow() } } } . | you need a mechanism to indicate that the onboarding flow is complete. Typically this is accomplished via a button click. Thus in the viewcontroller responsible for handing onboarding user interactions, create an action that toggles the isFirstTimeUser boolean flag to false. | If you use a storyboard, the code for that would look something like this: . swift class OnboardingViewControllerOrPageController { //MARK: - Properties @IBOutlet weak var onboardingCompletedButton: UIButton! ... //MARK:- Actions @IBOutlet func onboardingCompletedButtonTapped(_ sender: UIButton) { let isFirstTimeUser = false let defaults = UserDefaults.standard defaults.set(isFirstTimeUser, forKey: &quot;isFirstTimeUser&quot;) //add code for what happens after boolean is switched } } . If you use programatic constraints, the code looks something like this: . swift class OnboardingViewControllerOrPageController { private func whenOnBoardingCompletedButtonIsTapped() { onboardingView.onboardingCompletedButton.addTarget(self, action: #selector(ActionButtonProtocol.buttonTapped(_:)), for: .touchUpInside) } private buttonTapped(_ sender: UIButton) { let isfirstTimeUser = false let defaults = UserDefaults.standard defaults.set(isfirstTimeUser, forKey: &quot;isfirstTimeUser&quot;) coordinator?.onboardingCompleted() } } Note that the coordinator handles wnat to present next after onboarding is completed (via a call to `coordinator?.onboardingCompleted()` function). This is because we typicaly want to present a new ViewController (thus returning to applications default flow) at this point - presenting any ViewController is the responsibility of a coordinator because coordinators deal with navigation flow. . Summary . The logic followed/implemented is simple. . Is this a first time user? | Yes =&gt; present the onboarding flow | No =&gt; present the application’s usual flow | . Resetting UserDefaults . Discovered that UserDefaults does not have a reset function while testing. 2 options that work are: . use removeObject function to remove the key of a set value thus setting resetting the entire key-value to nil. For example: UserDefaults.standard.removeObject(forKey: &quot;isFirstTimeUser&quot;) . | writing an extension. Bart Jacobs has a really good post on this here . | .",
